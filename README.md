Final project: Die Hard Work

All current work is in the directory 'protocheckers'.
While the actual checkers game itself isnt implimented as of yet, client-server comnication and data base maintanance is. Users can join games of checkers with anouther browser and the gameboard is kept updated between the two clients as they move the peices.
